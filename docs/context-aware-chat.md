# Context-Aware Chat with Able

## Overview

The context-aware chat feature allows Able AI to provide more relevant and helpful assistance based on the current page the user is on. When a user clicks "Chat with Able" from any page, the system automatically detects the page context and provides tailored assistance.

## How It Works

### 1. Context Detection

The system uses the `detectPageContext()` function to analyze the current URL and determine:
- **Page Type**: profile, gigs, settings, calendar, notifications, etc.
- **Section**: specific area within the page (edit, view, create, etc.)
- **Action**: what the user is currently doing (editing, browsing, configuring, etc.)
- **Description**: human-readable description of the current context
- **Available Actions**: list of actions the user can perform on this page

### 2. Context Passing

When a user clicks "Chat with Able", the `ScreenHeaderWithBack` component:
1. Detects the current page context
2. Encodes the context as URL parameters
3. Navigates to the AI chat page with context information

### 3. Context Processing

The AI chat page:
1. Parses context from URL parameters
2. Generates a context-aware welcome message
3. Uses context to provide more relevant AI responses

## Supported Page Types

| Page Type | Description | Example Actions |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `profile` | Profile management | Update info, Add skills, Upload photo |
| `gigs` | Gig-related pages | Search gigs, Create gig, Apply to gigs |
| `settings` | Account settings | Update preferences, Change password |
| `calendar` | Schedule management | Set availability, View upcoming gigs |
| `notifications` | Notification center | Mark as read, Reply to messages |
| `offers` | Gig offers | Accept offers, View details |
| `delegate` | Gig delegation | Select worker, Set terms |
| `amend` | Gig amendments | Update details, Modify schedule |
| `report` | Issue reporting | Describe issue, Submit report |
| `home` | Dashboard | View activity, Quick actions |

## Implementation Details

### Context Detection Utility (`lib/context-detection.ts`)

```typescript
interface PageContext {
  pageType: 'profile' | 'gigs' | 'settings' | 'calendar' | 'notifications' | 'offers' | 'delegate' | 'amend' | 'report' | 'home' | 'unknown';
  section?: string;
  action?: string;
  data?: Record<string, any>;

}
```

### URL Parameter Format

Context is passed via URL parameters:
```
/user/123/able-ai?pageType=profile&section=edit&action=editing&description=You%20are%20editing%20your%20profile&availableActions=Update%20info,Add%20skills
```

### AI Prompt Enhancement

The AI receives context-aware prompts that include:
- Current page context
- Available actions
- User's specific message
- Relevant guidance for the current page
